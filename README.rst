Pack Tracker is a web application for organizing group gear during hiking
expeditions. Members can enter their gear inventory, create expeditions,
and check the items they are bringing. Pack Tracker allows users to
join other expeditions and contribute gear. Pack Tracker sends an email out
to all members of an expedition before the departure date with a list of
gear they are signed up for.
